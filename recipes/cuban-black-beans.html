    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            We need to use that pointer finger to cook now! Pour the 
            rice into a rice cooker. Now place your fingerip on the bottom of 
            the bowl and fill up to your first knuckle. Hehe gotcha! Rice cooker will
            do the rest.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a separate pot cook the onions, garlic, and bell peppers in the
            oil with saizon, chili powder, cumin, and italian seasoning. Once 
            the onions are translucent add the beans,tomatoes, and vegetable Broth
            and reduce. Serve up with rice and platanos if you have the time!
