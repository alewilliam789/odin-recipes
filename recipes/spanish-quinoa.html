    <p>
       While we know the Spanish make amazing rice (see paella), rice is normally
       really high in carbs and low in fiber. Instead we are going to make this 
       fantastic dish with a different "grain" called quinoa! Native to Peru, 
       it is a complete protein and has a solid carb-fiber ratio to reduce the carb-load
       of this dish!

    <h2>For the Beans</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cans of Pinto Beans</li>
        <li>1 can of Diced Tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 jar of Salsa (Pick one with a spice to it!)</li>
        <li>1 green bell pepper</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of Diced Garlic</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of Canola Oil (or nuetral oil)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of Chili Powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoons of Cumin</li>
        <li>1 tablespoons of Creole Seasoning (with salt)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>For the Quinoa</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5 cups of Quinoa</li>
        <li>3 cups of water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Start the quinoa first because it will need to be added
            to this dish after the veggies are cooked. Add the water and
            quinoa to a pot and put it on high until it boils. After reduce
            to medium or lower to simmer.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a separate pot cook the onions, garlic, and bell peppers in the
            oil with chili powder, cumin, and creole seasoning. Once 
            the onions are translucent, add the beans, tomatoes, salsa, and quinoa
            and reduce.
        </li>
    </ol>
